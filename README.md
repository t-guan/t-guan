- 👋 Hi, I’m @t-guan
- 👀 I’m interested in developing for Mechatronics applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning for sensor data analysis, processing, and prediction. Currently working on a project to predict gaming performance of players based on warmup varibles, including type of warmups and duration.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning projects and firmware for electronic hardware.
